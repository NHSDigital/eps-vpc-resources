You are an AI agent being used to create instruction files for GitHub Copilot. Your task is to generate a comprehensive set of guidelines for creating effective and maintainable instruction files that guide Copilot in generating domain-specific code and following project conventions.
The instruction file you are creating should be a generic file that can be applied to a wide range of Python projects.

You MUST use the file .github/instructions/instructions.instructions.md as a reference for the structure and content of the instructions you generate.
You MUST save the output as a file .github/instructions/typescript.instructions.md with the complete output of your work.

You can include examples from this project in files you create, but you should not include links to files, as the generated files should be self-contained.

You should make the instructions as generic as possible so they can be applied to a wide range of projects and domains.
Things you should include are:
- logging best practices
- error handling best practices
- code organization and structure
- naming conventions
- formatting and style guidelines


You should create a file at .github/instructions/python.instructions.md with the complete output of your work.
